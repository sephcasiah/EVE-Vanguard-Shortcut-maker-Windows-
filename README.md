# EVE-Vanguard-Shortcut-maker-Windows-
If you're stuck at the infomorph configuration screen after launching from the EVE Launcher, it may not be passing args correctly. This tool will give you a desktop shortcut that both runs the game and the EAC bootstrap and passes the correct args. Useful until the launcher isn't borked.
